# LeetAI - AI Engineering Skills Project

This 3-week project is about using AI to revise and cement AI engineering skills.

## Week 1: Data Structures & Algorithms 

Focused on revising classic data structures and algorithms, with some C and Make practice.

It's questionable whether you would hand-crank this in a real job, even before AI. This week explores how to use AI to do the rote generation, while I walk through the reasoning.

## Week 2A: HuggingFace LLM SFT

Master the modern NLP toolkit - from tokenizers to transformers, fine-tuning to RLHF. The Hugging Face course notebooks cover the full pipeline: datasets, model training, sharing, and deployment with practical examples across major NLP tasks.

## Week 2B: Build an LLM from Scratch

Build an LLM from scratch in PyTorch - GPT-2 is the new MNIST!

## Week 3: CUDA Optimization

Patterns in optimizing and debugging CUDA kernels.
